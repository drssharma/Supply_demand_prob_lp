### Supply and Demand Linear Programming Problem
#### Objective:
The main objective of this project is to explain one secenrio of demand and supply  in Linear programming problem and find its optimal solution in Python using Pulp library.  
### what is Optimization?
“Optimization” comes from the same root as “optimal”, which means best. When you optimize something, you are “making it best”. But “best” can vary. If you’re a football player,you might want to maximize your running yards, and also minimize your fumbles. Both maximizing and minimizing are types of optimization problems. 
Mathematically, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function.
### The demand and supply problem:
You want to minimize the cost of shipping goods from 2 different warehouses to 4 different customers. Each warehouse has a limited supply and each customer has a certain demand. We need to fulfil the demand of the customers by shipping products from given warehouses such that the overall cost of shipping is minimum and we are also able to satisfy the customer demands using limited supply available with each warehouse.

First, I formulated the problem in LP and then solved it using pulp in Python.
